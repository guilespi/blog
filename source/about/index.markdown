I'm a Software Engineer from Uruguay, for many years I lead the Product and Engineering team at [inConcert](http://www.inconcertcc.com "inConcert").
Now I'm pursuing some personal adventures and doing consulting and contracting for interesting projects.

There's a saying that if you wanna learn something you should write a book about it, so this is my shot at Software Development.

I hope to write more the days I'm mad, since nothing worth of note has come from love and happiness.

You can find some of the stuff I've shipped [here][1]
