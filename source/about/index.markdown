I'm a Software Engineer from Uruguay, I lead the product and engineering team at [inConcert](http://www.inconcertcc.com "inConcert").
For the last 20+ years I've been trying to learn something about software development, and I'm not really sure whether I'm close yet or not.

There's a saying that if you wanna learn something, write a book about it, so this is my shot.

I hope to write more the days I'm mad, nothing worth of note has come from love and happiness.

If you find this blog too quiet for your taste, I'm also quiet on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/guilespi)
