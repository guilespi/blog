I've written a post for [cabeza propia][1] on [distribution of wealth][2]. If you read spanish, take a look.

The main point is there's a semantic misunderstanding of what distribution of wealth is, confusing a statistical [frequency distribution][3] of income, with the transitive verb `distribute`.
As if the current distribution of wealth is the result of someone who decided to distribute it unfairly.

I pretty much agree on [Paul Graham's take][4] on wealth creation, and think our focus should be on individuals being able to create more value for society and for themselves.

The semantic confusion may be just part of the reason we're having the wrong conversation, about distributing, instead of being about affecting the distribution by creating.
